## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to reference the nth-child of various html tags.  There was a lot of flexbox exercise in this challenge also, which was fun.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.rating {
  &:nth-child(1) {
    transform: translateX(-6rem);
  }

  &:nth-child(2) {
    transform: translateX(-3rem);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I am going to continue to focus on Sass but I want to start putting all of these projects into react.
